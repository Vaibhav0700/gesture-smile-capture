# gesture-smile-capture
This project utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Haar cascades to create a smart image capture system that detects smiles and hand gestures (peace sign ✌️) to automatically save images. The system integrates face and smile detection using Haar cascades and hand tracking via MediaPipe, ensuring real-time, hands-free image capture.
